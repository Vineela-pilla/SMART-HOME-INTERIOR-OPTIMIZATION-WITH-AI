# SMART-HOME-INTERIOR-OPTIMIZATION-WITH-AI
“SMART HOME INTERIOR OPTIMIZATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” 
represents an AI-powered solution that leverages YOLO-based object detection to analyse and 
enhance interior designs from user-uploaded images. By evaluating key aesthetic factors such as 
object type, color coordination, and spatial harmony, the system generates a style rating for each 
room. If the rating falls below a predefined threshold, the AI intelligently enhances the image by 
modifying existing décor, adding complementary elements, or rearranging items to achieve a more 
cohesive look. Users receive a rating,recomdations,dashboard for the result, along 
with style scores and curated recommendations that include item names, prices, colours, and 
availability from platforms like Amazon or Flipkart. Developed using technologies such as Python, 
OpenCV, and web scraping APIs, the platform offers an intuitive and engaging interface where 
users—whether homeowners or interior designers—can effortlessly explore and upgrade their 
spaces. The system not only simplifies the complexities of home décor but also adapts to user 
preferences and emerging design trends, offering a scalable, intelligent, and visually driven 
approach to creating harmonious living environments.
